### Creating an R Script

1.  From the "File" menu, select "New File"
2.  Click "R Script" from the list of options

RStudio should open your R Script automatically after creating it. Notice a new pane appears above the Console. This is called the **Source pane** and is where we write and edit R code and documents. This pane is only present if there are files open in the editor.

3.  Save the R Script in your `script` folder, name the file `intro-to-programming.R`
